## Description
This project extends the analysis performed in "The Effect of Minimum Wages on Low-Wage Jobs" by Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer, which estimates the impact of minimum wage increases on employment using a difference-in-differences approach. Using ML techniques like Double-Lasso, this study replicates and refines the reference paper, revealing nuanced impacts across wage tiers and demographics. It confirms nuanced job distribution changes post-minimum wage hikes, aiding policymakers in crafting more informed, equitable labor policies.

## Objectives:
 1. Find the most suitable treatment and control groups to support the parallel assumption.
 2. To identify the most important features, and explore minimum wage using ML for detailed insights.

## Files and Data
- `Figure2_for_QJE`: Contains state panel data for the years 1979-2016.
Datasets are identified with "statenum" and "quarterdate" to align the analyzed observations. (Download from: https://github.com/mjahangiralam/Data-Science-for-Economic-and-Social-Issues/tree/main/DiD/Cengiz-et-al)

- `StateMinimumWage_Changes.xlsx`: Contains the historical data on changes to the minimum wage across various states in the United States and employment rate. 

- `DID_GROUP_project (1).ipynb`: Replication code, contains the replication method in Python for Figure 2 in the cited paper.

- `Double Lasso Enhance DiD.ipynb`: Enhancement code, contains the Double-Lasso method, regression model, and data visualization.
- The datasets include:

estimates.zip
tables.zip
figures.zip
Each containing multiple files with detailed information pertinent to our research focus.
  
## Methods

The Double-Lasso model :
- Data import: Coning the dataset `Figure2_for_QJE` from Github.
- Regression analysis and visualization: Run the code in `Double Lasso Enhance DiD.ipynb`, including cleaning data, and build a panel regression model, applying  `matplotlib` library to generate plots.

The key variables used in the analysis are:
-  `wagebinstate`, `weight'Y''b'`, `wtoverall1979`, `wmax`,`wmin`: Feature variables represent changes in minimum wages in each state.
- `treat_p.j`,`treat_m.j` `Ftreat_p.j`, `Ltreat_p.j``Ltreat_m.j`: The treatment variable whether the salary changes according to a certain time node in this paper.
- `overallcountpcall`: represents the percentage of the population corresponding to changes in the minimum wage.


## Analysis
- Double-Lasso enhances precision by selecting New York and Arkansas based on parallel trends.
- Plotting shows nuanced effects of minimum wage changes on different wage tiers.
- Model discerns subtle impacts, improving understanding of minimum wage effects.

## Results
- The replication process consolidates control variables into a single data frame for regression analysis.
- Placebo test applied to regression output in DiD methodology reveals new coefficients.
- ML-enhanced Double-Lasso selects New York (treatment) and Arkansas (control) for analysis.
